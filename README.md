# whats in the project ?
This is just a simple project , where I used html and css to build and style the landing page of Netflix.
I've structed it as 
        1.header :
            - logo
            - navigation 
                 - language button
                 - Sign In button
        2. section:
             - the text by using  h1 ,h3 , <p>
             - form
                 - email adress 
                 - get started button

I've styled each and every sub section in the styles.css
I've made it responsive for screens smaller than 768px and 480px
